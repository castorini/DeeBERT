ROBERTA_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    The RoBERTa model was proposed in
    `RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach`_
    by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer,
    Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018.
    
    It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining
    objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.
    
    This implementation is the same as BertModel with a tiny embeddings tweak as well as a setup for Roberta pretrained 
    models.

    This model is a tf.keras.Model `tf.keras.Model`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and
    refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    .. _`RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach`:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692

    .. _`tf.keras.Model`:
        https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model

    Note on the model inputs:
        TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

            - having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
            - having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

        This second option is usefull when using `tf.keras.Model.fit()` method which currently requires having all the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

        If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the first positional argument :

        - a single Tensor with input_ids only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)
        - a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
            `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
        - a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associaed to the input names given in the docstring:
            `model({'input_ids': input_ids, 'token_type_ids': token_type_ids})`

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.RobertaConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the 
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.
"""

ROBERTA_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            To match pre-training, RoBERTa input sequence should be formatted with <s> and </s> tokens as follows:

            (a) For sequence pairs:

                ``tokens:         <s> Is this Jacksonville ? </s> </s> No it is not . </s>``

            (b) For single sequences:

                ``tokens:         <s> the dog is hairy . </s>``

            Fully encoded sequences or sequence pairs can be obtained using the RobertaTokenizer.encode function with 
            the ``add_special_tokens`` parameter set to ``True``.

            RoBERTa is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on
            the right rather than the left.

            See :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **attention_mask**: (`optional`) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED tokens.
        **token_type_ids**: (`optional` need to be trained) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Optional segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs.
            This embedding matrice is not trained (not pretrained during RoBERTa pretraining), you will have to train it
            during finetuning.
            Indices are selected in ``[0, 1]``: ``0`` corresponds to a `sentence A` token, ``1``
            corresponds to a `sentence B` token
            (see `BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding`_ for more details).
        **position_ids**: (`optional`) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings.
            Selected in the range ``[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1[``.
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.
        **inputs_embeds**: (`optional`) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)``:
            Optionally, instead of passing ``input_ids`` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors
            than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

    Outputs: `Tuple` comprising various elements depending on the configuration (config) and inputs:
        **scores**: ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, config.num_labels)``
            Classification scores (before SoftMax).
        **hidden_states**: (`optional`, returned when ``config.output_hidden_states=True``)
            list of ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` (one for the output of each layer + the output of the embeddings)
            of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)``:
            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        **attentions**: (`optional`, returned when ``config.output_attentions=True``)
            list of ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` (one for each layer) of shape ``(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)``:
            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention heads.
